Learn to use some basic system calls.

```haskell
ghci> :module System.Cmd
ghci> rawSystem "ls" ["-l", "/usr"]
total 212
drwxr-xr-x   3 root root 40960 Oct 27 08:08 bin
drwxr-xr-x 321 root root 36864 Oct 26 12:35 include
drwxr-xr-x 145 root root 90112 Oct 26 12:35 lib
...
```

So lets code this:

```haskell
import System.Process
main :: IO ()
main = do rawSystem "ls" ["-l", "/usr"]
```

Compile it:

```bash
$ ghc Main.hs
    Couldn't match type `GHC.IO.Exception.ExitCode' with `()'
    Expected type: IO ()
      Actual type: IO GHC.IO.Exception.ExitCode
```

We see from the
[documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/process/1.0.1.1/doc/html/System-Process.html)
that the signature to rawSystem is: 

```haskell
rawSystem :: String -> [String] -> IO ExitCode
```

but we know main must return `IO ()`.  Well putting in: `return ()`

```haskell
main = do 
  rawSystem "ls" ["-l", "/usr"]
  return ()
```

lets it compile:

```bash
$ ghc Main.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Main.hs, Main.o )
Linking Main ...
$ Main
total 212
drwxr-xr-x   3 root root 40960 Oct 27 08:08 bin
drwxr-xr-x 321 root root 36864 Oct 26 12:35 include
drwxr-xr-x 145 root root 90112 Oct 26 12:35 lib
```

however this is quite useless, we'd like to read a directory, put it
into some type of data structure, do some analysis, then print out a
result right?  Why don't we sum the file sizes, so mimic the `du -sh`
command? 

At the documentation page, I found a command called: 

```haskell
readProcess :: FilePath -> [String] -> String -> IO String
```

so lets give this one a try:

```haskell
main = do 
  a <- readProcess "ls" ["-l", "/usr"] []
  print a
  return ()
```

compiling...

```bash
$ ghc Main
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Main.hs, Main.o )
Linking Main ...
$ Main
"total 212\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root 40960 Oct 27 08:08 bin\ndrwxr-xr ...
```

Something very tricky just transpired!  The `<-` operator converted an
`IO String` to a `String`, something that a lot of documentation says
you CAN'T do.  The reason you can do it, is that we are already in a
function that will return an `IO ()`.

It's very important for you to see how we just moved from an IMPURE,
step, to a pure step.  Of course ultimately we must go back to
Monads/impure, etc..., because main must return an `IO ()`.

Moving on.  Lets convert the big string in lines with the `lines`
function!  Well lets find the definition of `lines` first!!!  Here are
a few ways to find information about functions:

* [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle)

* From GHCI: `:info lines` or `:i lines` for short.

```haskell
  a <- readProcess "ls" ["-l", "/usr"] []
  myLines = lines a
  return ()
```

But this doesn't work!

```bash
 $ ghc Main.hs
Main.hs:7:11: parse error on input `='
```

Damn!  The reason for this is that the `do` notation is syntactic
sugar, that must be used properly.  Lets look at an example:

```haskell
do
   putStrLn "What is your name?"
   name <- getLine
   putStrLn ("Welcome, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

is the syntactic sugar for:

```haskell
putStrLn "What is your name?"
>>= (\_ -> getLine)
>>= (\name -> putStrLn ("Welcome, " ++ name ++ "!"))
```

What the `>>=` bind infix operator does, is take the value on the left
and apply it to the function on the right.  Here is the signature for
`putStrLn`: 

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
```

So it results in an `IO ()`.  Lets quickly review how anonymous
function work.

```haskell
ghci> (\x -> x + 1) 4
5 :: Integer
```

The previous example is run in the GHCI environment.  Basically: `(\x
-> x + 1)` is the anonymous function part.  `4` is the argument to the
anonymous function.  We start anonymous functions with a `\` because
it looks a bit like a lambda sign, which is a synonym for anonymous
function from math.  The next part between `\` and `->` 












`split` looks like a candidate to break up a line on a delimeter:

```haskell
  myLines = lines a
  splitter = split (==' ')
  splitLines = map splitter myLines
```

This guide is for using Arch Linux with your Beagle Bone Black.

Before you connect your BBB to your computer run: `ifconfig -a` and
note which interfaces you have, mine has: eth0, lo, and wlan0.

This assumes you are ONLY connecting to your BBB via a USB cable.

After you've plugged it in you can do an `lsblk` to determine the
device, mine was `/dev/sdc`.

You can mount and browse this easily enough with:

    % sudo mkdir -p /mnt/bbb
    % sudo mount /dev/sdc /mnt/bbb
    % cd /mnt/bbb; ls

Next you want to issue: `ipconfig -a`, my system shows: eth0, eth1,
lo, wlan0, after having connected the BBB, therefore the network
device that will connect to the BBB is eth1.

I used `netctl`.  I copied and edited the `

    % cd /etc/netctl
    % sudo cp /examples/ethernet-dhcp bbb
    % cat bbb
    Description='A basic dhcp ethernet connection'
    Interface=eth1
    Connection=ethernet
    IP=dhcp

I enabled and started the network with: 

    % sudo netctl enable bbb
    % sudo netctl start bbb

Now `ifconfig -a` reveals the IP address, which is 192.168.7.1.  Keep
in mind that this is the computer side of the network's IP, the BBB
should have the IP address: 192.168.7.2.  So you can now browse via a
browser, or ssh in.  There is no password for the `root` user.
